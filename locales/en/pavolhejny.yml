title: Who I am?
content: >
I'm Pavol, a developer and tech enthusiast passionate about exploring cutting-edge tools and technologies.
As a co-founder of [H-edu](https://www.h-edu.cz/) and [Collboard](https://collboard.com/),
I'm invested in using digital innovation to transform education.
I've developed several citizen science projects, including the first mobile app for birdwatchers in the Czech Republic,
and spoken at tech and startup conferences on topics like VR, AR, and AI. I also run [Czech.events](https://czech.events/),
a platform that helps people find and attend technology and innovation events.
My talent for identifying opportunities for growth and mentoring startups has led me to win several innovation competitions.
I'm committed to inspiring others and believe technology can help solve the world's problems.
