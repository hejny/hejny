title: Who I am?
content: >
    I'm Pavol, a developer and tech enthusiast who is passionate about exploring cutting-edge tools and technologies. As a co-founder of H-edu and Collboard, I'm invested in using digital innovation to transform education. I've developed several citizen science projects, including the first mobile app for birdwatchers in the Czech Republic, and spoken at tech and startup conferences on topics such as VR, AR and AI. I also run Czech.events, a platform that helps people find and attend technology and innovation events. My talent for identifying growth opportunities and mentoring startups has led me to win several innovation competitions. I'm committed to inspiring others and believe that technology can help solve the world's problems.
