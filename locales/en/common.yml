        Are you leveraging the **full potential of technology** and generative AI in your business?


        Technology is constantly evolving and we are currently experiencing a massive wave of the emergence of **generative AI**,
        which is becoming more and more like the massive rise of the personal computer or the early days of the internet.


        It is almost certain that virtually every sector of human activity will be affected by this revolution,
        and there will be winners and losers from this massive change.


        It is virtually impossible to maintain an awareness of all that is happening in the field of technology and to filter out the key technologies from the daily noise.
        **I'd be happy to help you with all of that.**

    title: Who I am?
    content: |
        I'm Pavol, a developer who is passionate about using new tools and technologies.

        Currently, I am focusing on the Promptbook framework - a new way of using AI models in a more human-like way.

        I am a member of the Ainautes consulting group, which supports with the deployment of generative AI around the world.

        Before the massive emergence of generative AI, I have created the first Czech virtual whiteboard, Collboard, and electronic textbooks, H-edu, which were used by tens of thousands of children.

        I have also worked on many scientific projects for the Czech Ornithological Society.
        I regularly give lectures at conferences, sit on juries, and act as a mentor in many Czech and international competitions.
        I have a special heart for this, and I love open-source - you can find many of my things on my GitHub.

        ## FAQ

        ### How does the training work?

        The training takes place within your company or online. I will come to you within the Czech Republic, or I can travel to nearby abroad (Bratislava, Vienna,...)


        ### Which variant to choose?

        Both variants are preceded by a **non-binding call** where we will discuss together what exactly you are solving.
        1) If you develop absolutely anything, variant 1 is for you.
        2) For companies that specifically develop AI applications, variant 2 is suitable.

        ### How long does the training take and when can it take place?

        - **Variant 1**: Training lasts **half a day** and can take place anytime by agreement.
        - **Variant 2**: Training lasts one day and it's best if it starts in the morning and ends in the evening.
                          If your company is in Prague, we can split it into two days, e.g. Wednesday afternoon and Thursday morning.
                    

        ### What experience do you have with development and AI?

        - I have been programming since 2007
        - Web applications since 2008 *(PHP, Flash)*
        - In JavaScript since 2012
        - In TypeScript since 2015
        - I started using the first generative AI in 2021 with the advent of GPT-2

        ### We develop application X in language Y, can you help us?

        I myself best understand web and mobile applications written in TypeScript or JavaScript.
        However, if you program in another language, it doesn't matter, I have experience with other programming languages and can consult even so,
        although I may not be able to help with very specific questions and details.


        ### How much can AI increase development efficiency? Is the training worth it for me?

        This is very individual and depends on the specific application.
        In practice, however, it is usually a surprisingly substantial increase in efficiency, but it's not a miracle that would replace developers.

        Generative AI can increase efficiency mainly for clearly defined tasks where it's about "just writing code".
        On the contrary, application architecture and its design require a senior developer.
        Similarly, sometimes you encounter an error that only a human developer can handle.

        As I write, it depends very much on the specific application, but generally it can be said:

        - **25%** time on clearly defined tasks; GenAI will help with this by 30%
        - **25%** time on application design and architecture; GenAI won't help here
        - **15%** time on writing tests; GenAI will help with this by 60%
        - **20%** time on implementation; GenAI will help with this by 50%
        - **15%** time on documentation; GenAI will help with this by 90%

        `(0.25*0.3)+(0.25*0)+(0.15*0.6)+(0.20*0.5)+(0.15.0.9) = 0.265`

        Overall, AI can increase development efficiency by **about 25%**, i.e. a quarter.

        If you have salary costs for developers of â‚¬4,000/month and you have 5 developers, you can save up to **â‚¬5,000 every month**.

        > This means training in variant 1 for â‚¬1,400 will **pay for itself in less than 10 days**.

        *I'm neglecting the costs of Github Copilot and ChatGPT+ here, which are negligible compared to salary costs.*

        *This is of course a very simplified model, but it can help you make decisions.*

        ### How much better is training than just starting to use GitHub Copilot?

        Just by using GitHub Copilot you can increase development efficiency.
        However, if you don't know how to properly utilize its potential, you probably won't get the maximum out of its possibilities with the right methodology.

        ### What are the payment options?

        50% payment to account in advance and half after training. I will issue an invoice to my business ID. 
        Payment also possible in Euros to EUR account according to current exchange rate.

        ### Why is training more expensive than other training?

        This training is training from developer to developer. You will learn many internal insights directly from application development.

        If you are interested in the most current overview of AI tools, I recommend training from [TomÃ¡Å¡ Kapler](https://www.kapler.cz/ai-skoleni).
        If you are more interested in insight into AI as such *(not AI in the context of application development)*,
        I can recommend training from Ainautes, who specialize in placing AI in a broader context.

        ### Why are the examples in TypeScript?

        `TypeScript` is the language I have the most experience with and it's a language that is very suitable for developing large user applications.
        `JavaScript` is the same, but without type checking, which may be more suitable for smaller projects.

        If your company uses another language, it doesn't matter, I can adapt. I myself have experience with `Java`, `Python`, `C`, `C++`, `PHP` and `Haskell`.
