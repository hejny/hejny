        Are you leveraging the **full potential of technology** and generative AI in your business?


        Technology is constantly evolving and we are currently experiencing a massive wave of the emergence of **generative AI**,
        which is becoming more and more like the massive rise of the personal computer or the early days of the internet.


        It is almost certain that virtually every sector of human activity will be affected by this revolution,
        and there will be winners and losers from this massive change.


        It is virtually impossible to maintain an awareness of all that is happening in the field of technology and to filter out the key technologies from the daily noise.
        **I'd be happy to help you with all of that.**

    title: Who I am?
    content: >
        I'm Pavol, a developer who is passionate about using new tools and technologies.

        I specialise in creating fully functional user applications using the latest artificial intelligence models.

        I am a member of the Ainautes consulting group, which supports with the deployment of generative AI around the world.

        I develop the WebGPT web page generation service.

        Before the massive emergence of generative AI, I have created the first Czech virtual whiteboard, Collboard, and electronic textbooks, H-edu, which were used by tens of thousands of children.

        I have also worked on many scientific projects for the Czech Ornithological Society.
        I regularly give lectures at conferences, sit on juries, and act as a mentor in many Czech and international competitions.
        I have a special heart for this, and I love **open source** - you can find many of my things on my GitHub.
