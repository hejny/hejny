                        Collboard is an online virtual whiteboard that offers simplicity, creativity, and closeness to
                        content. It&apos;s built with customization in mind, giving teachers the flexibility to build
                        their own teaching paths. Collboard is also modular, allowing for various subjects and use cases
                        to be combined. It&apos;s available on all devices and can be used for all forms of online
                        collaboration, including education and beyond.
