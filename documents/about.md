I am co-founder of a platform for teachers, [H-Edu](https://www.h-edu.cz/); when the quarantine on March 2020 began, he founded an **online virtual board** [**CollBoard.com**](https://collboard.com/). He worked on several projects of the Czech Ornithological Society([Česká společnost ornitologická](https://www.birdlife.cz/)) and in the past, he also developed his [**online game Towns**](https://github.com/townsgame).

In terms of community, he has organized several conferences. For example, [in autumn 2019, he organized the CzechFuture.tech](https://blog.pavolhejny.com/nulty-rocnik-czech-future-tech/). He co-organized some hackathons like Educational hackathon or Startup Weekends in Prague.

At the same time, he participated in many events and startup competitions as a **mentor** and a **jury**.

He has spoken at many conferences such as [**DevConf**](https://www.devconf.info/)**,** [**LinuxDays**](https://www.linuxdays.cz/)**,** [**OpenAlt**](https://www.openalt.cz/)**,** [**Czech VR Fest**](https://www.facebook.com/czechvrfest/), + many other meetups like [Frontendisti](https://www.facebook.com/frontendisti/), [ITnetwork.cz](https://www.facebook.com/itnetworkcz/), [Jobs Dev](https://www.facebook.com/jobsdevcz/), etc.

He has an overview of what is happening in the Czech Republic for IT & startup events. That's why he is sending out a regular monthly email about the most exciting events at [Czech.events](https://czech.events/).
